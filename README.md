</p>
<p>
- The Admin Panel is for system configuration and management (used by administrators)
</p>
- Agent Panel is for handling support tickets (used by help desk staff).
</p>
- To confirm you are in the Admin Panel, verify that the "Agent Panel" option is displayed in the top-right cornerâ€”this indicates you are currently in the administrative interface.
</p>
 - Next, we are going to configure a new role in the Admin Panel. Go to Agents > Roles > Add New Role
<br />

</p>
<p>
-  Name this role "Supreme Admin" and then click on the Permissions Tab.
</p>
- Since this is an Admin role, we want this to have all of the Permissions. Under Tickets, make sure you clicked on all 13 permissions. Go to the Tasks Tab and do the same.
</p>
- Then go to the Knowledge tab and check "Premade". You can now click Add Role.
</p>
<br />

</p>

</p>
<p>
- Now in the Settings Tab, Leave the Parent as "Top Level Department". Under that, you can name this "SysAdmins". We succesfully added SysADmin to the Departments.

</p>
<p>
- Now, on the same screen, click on Settings > Users.
</p>
- Here we'll enable guest ticket submissions so users can submit tickets without needing an account. This allows end users to create tickets quickly without any registration steps. Make sure it's unchecked, then click Save Changes.

<p>

</p>
<p>
- We'll add Agents now. Go to Agents > Agents > Add New Agent.
</p> 
- In the Account tab, you can name this agent "Jane Doe". Enter whatever email you want.
</p>
- Username: jane
</p>

<p>
-Letâ€™s create another agentâ€”click "Add New Agent" again. Name this agent John Doe, and for the email, you can use a placeholder since this is just for lab purposes. Set the password following the same method we used for Jane Doe earlier
</p>
- Next, navigate to the Access tab. Under Primary Department, select Support. Then, ensure you enable Expanded Access permissions (located to the right).
</p>
- Note: While "View Only" access may seem sufficient initially, selecting Expanded Access helps prevent workflow issues later in the lab environment.

<p>
- You can see all the Topics you just made here. Help Topics in osTicket serve a critical organizational purposeâ€”they act as a categorization system for incoming tickets, ensuring requests are automatically routed to the correct department or team. 
</p>
- Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully completed the osTicket Post-Install Configuration lab. By setting up departments, agents, SLAs, and help topics, youâ€™ve built the foundation for a streamlined ticketing system.
